        <h3>Our story</h3>
        <p class="A">
          Our story begins over 50 years ago, in the days when Grandpa Haim
          Spitzer immigrated to Israel. He immediately recognized the need for a
          basic product - bread. Hish Meher rolled up his sleeves and opened a
          small, home bakery. Not much time passed and he added special and
          designed whipped creams to the range of products, along with cakes and
          cookies, mainly for banquet halls and parties. One of Grandfather
          Chaim's joys was to make a bride and groom happy with challah and
          special cakes for their special day. He distributed all the products
          he produced himself while riding his bicycle, and later on a horse and
          cart. Those were magical and sweet years.
